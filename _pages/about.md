<!-- I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [*Agricultural Economics and Policy Group*](https://aecp.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich since 2022. My core expertise lies in production economics, and my research interests include the economics of climate change mitigation, political economy, and agricultural and environmental economics.

My current research and teaching focus on two main areas: (i) environmental economics and (ii) the economics of resilience. The first examines the costs of greenhouse gas and ammonia abatement and biodiversity loss reduction in agriculture, highlighting the role of financial institutions and labor and land markets in fostering environmentally sustainable yet economically viable farming systems. The second investigates the analyzing the short- and long-run effects of weather variability climate change adaptation on farm profitability, and the role of institutions on fostering recovery in the aftermath of natural disasters.

I was previously a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Economics at the University of Southampton, UK.

**I am on the 2025–2026 academic job market and open to interview invitations.** -->
