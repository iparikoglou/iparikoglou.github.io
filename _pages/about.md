Welcome to my personal website!

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [*Agricultural Economics and Policy Group*](https://aecp.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich since 2022. My core expertise is on production economics, and my research interests lie on agricultural and environmental economics.

My current research and teaching focus on two main areas:

  - *Environmental economics*: In this area, I examine how to foster food and farming systems that are both environmentally sustainable and economically viable. I am particularly interested in the role of policies, institutions, financial systems, and labor and land markets in promoting biodiversity conservation.

  - *Economics of resilience*: Here, I study the effects of weather variability and climate change adaptation on farm production and environmental pressures, as well as the overall resilience of farming and food systems. A particular focus lies on understanding heterogeneity in adaptive capacity and responses across farms, driven by differences in technology, management practices, resource endowments, and institutional settings.

**I am on the 2025–2026 academic job market and welcome interview invitations.**
